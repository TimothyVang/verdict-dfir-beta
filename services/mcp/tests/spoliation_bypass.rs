//! Read-only / spoliation bypass battery — the product's READ-ONLY-EVIDENCE
//! safety boundary exercised at the DB driver layer.
//!
//! Threat model. `browser_history` is the one DFIR tool that drives a real
//! query engine (`SQLite`) over an evidence file rather than a fixed-format
//! parser, so it is the surface where a "spoliation" attempt (mutate or destroy
//! the evidence) or a SQL-injection-style escape would land if anything were
//! mis-wired. The tool's defence is NOT a keyword blocklist that a clever
//! disguise could slip past — it opens the database with
//! `SQLITE_OPEN_READ_ONLY` (+ a `?immutable=1` URI), so the *driver* refuses
//! every write/delete/DDL/redirect attempt at the transaction boundary,
//! regardless of how the statement is spelled. These tests pin that boundary.
//!
//! What this proves (and what it does not). This battery proves the read-only
//! posture is enforced semantically by `SQLite`'s read-only transaction mode, not
//! lexically — lowercase, comment-hidden, UNION-prefixed, and subquery-bearing
//! mutations are all rejected identically. It also proves there is no injection
//! *surface*: every dynamic table/column projection comes from a fixed internal
//! allow-list, evidence values are never interpolated into SQL, and `case_id`
//! is never executed — a `case_id` carrying a `DROP TABLE` payload is read back
//! inertly and the table survives. It does NOT prove anything about the audit chain, the signed
//! manifest, or scoring — this is a pure tool-boundary characterization test
//! and is custody-neutral (no audit record, manifest, or verdict is produced).
//!
//! Note on `SQLite` vs "CALL". `SQLite` has no stored-procedure / `CALL` surface,
//! so that injection class is structurally absent; the subquery-bearing
//! `DELETE` below stands in as the "compound statement reaching a write" case
//! and is rejected by the same read-only driver boundary.
