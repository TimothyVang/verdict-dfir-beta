"""Cross-artifact correlator — enforces ``SOUL.md`` rules.

Spec #2 §8.1 (Correlate stage) + ``agent-config/SOUL.md`` invariant
"Execution claims need ≥2 artifact classes." This module is the
last gate before the verdict is assembled — it walks the merged
finding list and downgrades any "execution"-flavored claim whose
own description doesn't carry corroboration from a second
execution-artifact source (prefetch + registry pair, or EDR-tier
telemetry). Corroboration must appear in the Finding itself; other
findings elsewhere in the run do NOT corroborate it (the report-QA
gate, which sees timeline event linkage, is the layer that can join
same-binary/same-time findings across classes).

It also enforces the Amcache caveat (per
``agent-config/MEMORY.md``): ``Amcache LastModified`` is
catalog-registration time, NOT execution. A Finding that cites
Amcache as its only execution evidence is downgraded.

The execution gate is one member of a **family of named,
severity-tagged per-technique corroboration gates** (EXECUTION,
LATERAL_MOVEMENT, PRIVILEGE_ESCALATION, PERSISTENCE,
CREDENTIAL_ACCESS, DEFENSE_EVASION, COMMAND_AND_CONTROL). Each maps a
MITRE tactic onto the independent artifact-class pair(s) it requires
in the Finding's own text and emits a structured record
(``gate``/``severity``/``required_pairs``/``missing_classes``). The
family is deterministic and downgrade-only, and composes with the
per-claim-type confidence CEILING (the stricter constraint wins;
both only ever lower a tier).

The complementary EXONERATION direction is guarded by a curated
benign-clearance library (see
:func:`findevil_agent.correlator_benign.evaluate_benign_clearance`):
a benign clearance of a finding must be evidence-bound and never
softens a non-clearable signature (credential-dumping, log-clearing,
backup-destruction, defense-impairment) or a legit-tool / vendor-signed
demotion. It is HOLD-only — it never clears or raises a finding — and
opt-in via ``FIND_EVIL_REQUIRE_BENIGN_EVIDENCE`` (default-OFF).

This module is the PUBLIC FACADE: the gate family and ceiling table
live in :mod:`findevil_agent.correlator_gates`, the benign-clearance
library in :mod:`findevil_agent.correlator_benign`, and the cross-host
hygiene in :mod:`findevil_agent.correlator_crosshost`. They are all
re-exported here so ``from findevil_agent.correlator import X`` keeps
working unchanged.

Pure logic — no LLM calls, no I/O. Deterministic given the same
inputs.
