"""Pure ground-truth accuracy-scoring core — the single source of truth.

This module holds the *domain logic* for grading a finished Case against a curated
ground-truth golden: recall, precision/F1, hallucination rate, verdict consistency,
planted-bait detection, and negative-assertion coverage. It is offline and
read-only — it reads a case directory's ``verdict.json`` and a matching
``goldens/<id>/expected-findings.json`` and returns a plain report dict. It never
touches the sealed audit chain and is never part of the investigation pipeline.

Two callers share this one core (no logic fork):

  * ``scripts/score-recall.py`` — the hyphenated maintainer/grading CLI, which
    imports :func:`score` (and the resolver helpers) and adds only the CLI/printing
    layer; and
  * the ``accuracy_compare`` MCP shim — a read-only, audit-chained *diagnostic*
    tool. It is NOT a Finding: per CLAUDE.md, optional automation/scoring sidecars
    are never evidence and never create Findings, so the shim appends only a
    non-Finding ``accuracy_diagnostic`` audit record.

Matching: an expected finding is RECALLED when some run finding covers enough of
its distinctive description/artifact-hint tokens (coverage over the expected token
set, not symmetric Jaccard, so a verbose-but-correct run finding still matches a
concise ground-truth claim). MITRE technique is deliberately not a match shortcut.

Precision: a run finding matched to no expected claim is ``extra``. On an
``exhaustive`` (closed-world) key every extra is a false positive; on an open-world
key an extra is only PROVABLY wrong when it asserts a planted ``anti_fact``, a
``known_negative`` (benign IOC-lookalike), or a ``named_claim_denylist`` term.

Negative-assertion coverage: of the negative assertions a correct run must AVOID
(every ``anti_fact`` / ``known_negative`` / denylisted name in the key), how many
did the run correctly stay away from. 100% coverage means zero planted-bait
hallucinations.

# --- Measured ATT&CK coverage matrix (YAML golden assertions) ----------------
#
# verdict.json already exposes ``attack_coverage`` — a matrix of ATT&CK targets
# the run actually covered with typed-tool output (each row carries
# ``technique_id`` / ``status`` / ``finding_confidence`` /
# ``artifact_classes_observed``). The functions below grade that observed matrix
# against a per-case ``attack-assertions.yaml`` golden that declares which
# techniques the run is expected to surface and the minimum number of distinct
# artifact classes each must show. The output is a coverage matrix with a
# per-technique status:
#
#   * ``covered``            — observed with >= the declared minimum artifact classes;
#   * ``under_corroborated`` — observed but with fewer classes than the minimum
#     (the >=2-class corroboration doctrine encoded per technique in the golden);
#   * ``missing``            — absent from the matrix, or observed with no class.
#
# Like the recall scorer this is offline, read-only, and never touches the audit
# chain — it reads ``case_dir/verdict.json`` and a goldens YAML and returns a
# plain report dict. The assertions golden uses a deliberately tiny YAML subset so
# the parser stays stdlib-only (no PyYAML), keeping this module bare-python3
# runnable for the ``scripts/accuracy`` CLI and the ``score-recall.py`` path-load.

# Default minimum artifact classes when a technique omits ``min_artifact_classes``.
