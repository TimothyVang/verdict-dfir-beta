"""``manifest_finalize`` tool — build, sign, and write run.manifest.json.

Wraps :func:`findevil_agent.crypto.manifest.build_manifest` plus
:func:`write_manifest`. Three signer modes are exposed:

* ``signer="ed25519"`` — default real local-keypair signature; verifies
  offline from the public key embedded in the manifest bundle.
* ``signer="sigstore"`` — keyless sigstore signing via Fulcio + Rekor;
  the customer-release identity + transparency-log tier.
* ``signer="stub"`` — deterministic ``StubSigner``; used by tests
  and explicit dry-runs. Requires no network and produces a deterministic
  bundle keyed on the ``run_id`` for replay, but is never cryptographic proof.

The choice is exposed at the tool boundary because the agent often
wants to distinguish local integrity proof, customer-release identity proof,
and test-only placeholders.
