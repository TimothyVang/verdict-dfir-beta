# Cryptographic Chain of Custody

This document is the canonical answer to "how does VERDICT's
cryptographic attestation work, and how do I verify a manifest
someone else produced?" The story is scattered across CLAUDE.md,
README.md, the DC investigation report, and the demo script — this
file collects the load-bearing claims in one place.

> **Why this matters:** audit-trail quality turns on whether the
> agent's findings are independently verifiable by a third party
> with no trust in the agent itself. VERDICT's answer is "yes, offline,
> by `manifest_verify` plus signer trust obtained outside the case." An
> Ed25519 run requires the trusted public-key SHA-256 fingerprint; a
> Sigstore run requires the exact trusted identity and OIDC issuer. No
> live server is contacted during verification. This supplies the technical
> digital-identification record contemplated by FRE 902(14); legal
> self-authentication still requires a qualified person's certification and
> the Rule 902(11) notice process, as documented below.

> **Amendment A5 (2026-05-01):** the OpenTimestamps + Bitcoin
> anchoring tier was removed. The chain dropped from five links
> to four primitives composed across three tiers (audit chain →
> Merkle root → manifest signature). The Bitcoin tier required
> network reach to a calendar server plus a multi-hour wait for

> claim is in the "What FRE 902(14) requires" section.

## The three-link chain

![Chain of custody — manifest_finalize output: the hash-chained audit.jsonl, one Merkle leaf per tool_call_output, and audit_log_final_hash + merkle_root_hex bound into an ed25519-signed run.manifest.json](showcase/results-custody-chain.png)

Every VERDICT investigation produces a `run.manifest.json`
backed by composed cryptographic primitives across three tiers:

```
   evidence file (.e01 / .img / .evtx)
       │
       ▼  sha2 = 0.10 (Rust, in-process)
   image_hash (32-byte SHA-256, committed at case_open)
       │
       ▼  audit_append (append-only JSONL with prev_hash)
   audit chain  (each record: { kind, payload, prev_hash, seq, ts })
       │
       ▼  rs_merkle = 1.4 (Rust, in-process)
   Merkle tree over canonical-JSON record bytes
       │
       ▼  signer tier (Ed25519 default; Sigstore for identity; stub for tests)
   signature  (signed over the manifest body bytes)
```

Each link's role:

| # | Primitive | What it proves | Library |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | SHA-256 of the evidence | The image we read is the image we received | `sha2 = 0.10` (Rust) |
| 2 | Audit hash chain | No record was deleted, reordered, or back-dated after the fact | `services/agent/findevil_agent/crypto/audit_log.py` |
| 3 | rs_merkle tree | The set of records named in the manifest is the set the agent actually wrote | `rs_merkle = 1.4.0` (Rust) |
| 4 | manifest signature bundle | See signer tiers below — every run carries a bundle, but only a cryptographically verified Ed25519 or Sigstore tier authenticates the manifest | `cryptography` (ed25519) / `sigstore = 3.x` |

**Signer tiers** (choose with `--signer` / `FINDEVIL_SIGNER`; the manifest
records the tier that *actually* sealed the run in `signature.kind`):

| Tier | Default? | What it proves | Verified offline? |
|---|---|---|---|
| `ed25519` | **yes** | A real Ed25519 signature over the manifest body, signed with a local keypair (`~/.findevil/signing.key`, auto-generated; override `FINDEVIL_SIGNING_KEY`). Proves **integrity + local key continuity only when the verifier supplies that key's trusted SHA-256 fingerprint out of band** | **yes, with a trusted pin** — `manifest_verify` applies strict RFC 8032 validation, rebuilds the canonical body, and requires `expected_ed25519_fingerprint` (or `FINDEVIL_ED25519_EXPECTED_FINGERPRINT`) to match the public key; an embedded key alone never authenticates itself |
| `sigstore` | opt-in | Manifest integrity **plus identity**: the sealing key's Fulcio certificate is logged in Rekor, providing identity-bound public transparency-log provenance. The customer-release tier | **yes, with trusted policy** — the full bundle must verify against Sigstore's production roots and the verifier's exact expected identity **and** OIDC issuer; a bundle or embedded identity alone never authenticates itself |
| `stub` | explicit opt-in | Nothing cryptographic — a deterministic dev/offline placeholder | never (`signature_verified` honestly says so) |

A failed signer degrades honestly (`sigstore → ed25519 → stub`) with the
reason recorded in `signature.fallback_reason` — a run never crashes, and
never silently overstates its tier.

**No single primitive is load-bearing alone.** A SHA-256 by itself
proves byte equality but not freshness; a Merkle root proves set
membership but not who built the set; the signer tier states whether and
how the manifest was authenticated. Pinned Ed25519 proves local key continuity
offline, while Sigstore adds public identity and authenticated transparency-log
inclusion. Rekor's ordinary integrated time is not itself a cryptographically
trusted timestamp. The composition is the attestation.

The Rust side does the in-process content addressing (links 1 and
the per-tool output_sha256 that feeds the Merkle leaves). The
Python side composes the chain and signs.

## How a third party verifies offline

An auditor, regulator, or counter-party who has zero trust in the
agent can verify a VERDICT manifest with one tool, offline:

```bash
# The manifest signature, audit chain, and Merkle root.
# No network required. The case artifacts are self-contained, but signer trust
# is not: supply the Ed25519 pin obtained through a channel outside the case.
# Direct library call — no MCP server, no JSON-RPC plumbing.
uv run --directory services/agent python -c "
from pathlib import Path
from findevil_agent.crypto.manifest import verify_manifest
case = Path('<absolute-path-to-case-dir>')
r = verify_manifest(case / 'run.manifest.json',
                    audit_log_path=case / 'audit.jsonl',
                    expected_ed25519_fingerprint='<trusted SHA-256 obtained outside the case>')
print(r)
"
# Returns: ManifestVerification(audit_chain_ok=True, merkle_root_ok=True,
#                               leaf_count_ok=True, signature_present=True,
#                               overall=True)
# Any field becomes a string instead of True on failure, naming the
# precise reason (e.g. 'audit chain seq=4 prev_hash mismatch').
```

For an independent, zero-dependency cross-check on a stock Python 3
installation, run the standalone verifier directly:

```bash
python scripts/manifest-verify-offline.py \
    <absolute-path-to-case-dir>/run.manifest.json \
    --audit-log <absolute-path-to-case-dir>/audit.jsonl \
    --expected-ed25519-fingerprint <trusted-sha256-obtained-outside-the-case>
```

Its vendored verifier applies strict RFC 8032 input validation before the
Ed25519 equation: canonical point encodings, `S < L`, and exact prime-order
subgroup membership for both the public key and signature `R`. It also opens
the manifest as a bounded, identity-checked regular file without following a
final symlink. The pin must come from the operator/controller or another trusted
channel—not `signature.cert_fingerprint` in the manifest being tested. Sigstore
authentication still requires the product verifier's pinned trust roots and exact
identity/issuer policy; the dependency-free cross-check fails closed for that tier.

For a fuller workout that also exercises `audit_verify`,
`detect_contradictions`, `judge_findings`, and `correlate_findings`
through the actual MCP server (matching the live agent's flow),
run the smoke harness against the same case dir:

```bash
uv run --directory services/agent_mcp \
    python ../../scripts/agent-mcp-smoke.py \
    --real-evidence <absolute-path-to-case-dir>
```

The smoke spawns the server as a subprocess (matching `.mcp.json`),
drives it over piped stdio, and reports pass/fail per stage. This is
heavier than the direct library call but proves the MCP wire format
also passes — useful when verifying that what the live agent emits
is what the verifier consumes.

`manifest_verify` rebuilds:

1. The audit chain by walking `prev_hash` SHA-256 links from `seq=0`
   forward — first mismatch reports the seq + field that diverged.
   It then re-derives the record count, the final line hash, and the
   full Merkle-eligible leaf set from the replayed log and compares
   them to what the manifest declares — so a tail-truncated log, a
   post-seal append, or an internally-consistent forged leaf set all
   fail with a precise diagnostic, even though each is self-consistent
   on its own.
2. The Merkle tree from the manifest's `leaves[]` array — declared
   `merkle_root_hex` must match the rebuilt root byte-for-byte.
3. The signature bundle: `signature_present` confirms a bundle with a
   payload digest is attached, and `signature_verified` reports the
   honest cryptographic status — never `true` for a stub bundle (a
   deterministic placeholder is not proof), and a sigstore bundle is
   verified offline only against both an exact expected signer identity and
   exact OIDC issuer. `overall` always requires the signed-payload
   digest to match. A payload-bound `stub` remains development-advisory, while
   both `ed25519` and `sigstore` must cryptographically verify; a Sigstore label
   or arbitrary bundle is not authentication and fails closed.

If all checks pass, `overall=true`. Any one fails → `overall=false`
with a precise diagnostic naming the field and the expected vs actual
value. Tampering with the audit log, or with the manifest's account of
it, is loud for an authenticated Ed25519 or Sigstore tier. The honest limits per tier: an **ed25519**-signed run (the
default) verifies cryptographically offline only when the verifier supplies
the trusted external key fingerprint — `signature_verified=true` then proves
the manifest body is exactly what that pinned local key sealed — but a local
key carries no third-party identity; a **stub** bundle can demonstrate internal
chain/Merkle consistency but provides no authenticated tamper proof or signer
identity because an attacker could recompute the whole envelope. Only a real,
policy-verified Sigstore signature adds identity-bound transparency-log
provenance, which is why customer release requires `signer=sigstore`.

Native Windows custody sealing is currently fail-closed. Until VERDICT can
apply and verify private DACLs for the case directory, audit log, signing key,
manifest, memory database, and SQLite sidecars—and provide a Windows
interprocess audit lock—run signed cases under WSL2, Docker, or SIFT. Native
Windows smoke/readiness wrappers may inspect and package existing artifacts but
must not be read as a native custody-seal guarantee.

## Navigating the chain: the evidence traceability index

`manifest_verify` and `scripts/trace-finding` answer "is the chain
intact?". The companion **evidence traceability index** answers "show me
the exact line that backs this claim". It is a deterministic, no-LLM,
read-only join over `verdict.json` + `audit.jsonl` that maps, for every
Finding:

    claim (description) -> asserted entities/values
                        -> finding_id
                        -> each cited tool_call_id
                        -> the exact audit.jsonl line number + output_sha256

```bash
# Human table:
python -m scripts.evidence_traceability_index <run-dir>
# Machine-readable JSON (for tooling / report embedding):
python -m scripts.evidence_traceability_index <run-dir> --json
```

It re-walks the same canonical/`prev_hash` chain checks as the verifier:
a citation is `RESOLVED` only when its `tool_call_id` maps to a
`tool_call_output` record whose audit line is in canonical form on an
unbroken chain. A missing `tool_call_output` or a tampered line surfaces
the citation — and its owning Finding — as `UNRESOLVED`, and the process
exits non-zero. Re-running over the same directory is byte-identical.

This index is a **presentation / forensic-navigation aid only**. Per the
project guardrails, indexes and visuals never create Findings, satisfy
citations, or upgrade confidence; it only *navigates* the custody spine,
it does not change it. `scripts/build-offline-report.py --run-dir <run-dir>`
embeds the same table into the offline `report.html`.

## What FRE 902(14) requires and why this meets it

[Federal Rule of Evidence 902(14)](https://www.law.cornell.edu/rules/fre/rule_902)
("Certified Records Generated by an Electronic Process or System")
admits a digital record as **self-authenticating** — meaning the
proponent doesn't need to call a live witness to authenticate it —
when the record is supported by **a certification of a qualified
person** that complies with the certification requirements of Rule
902(11) or (12). Per the 2017 Advisory Committee Note, the
contemplated "process of digital identification" is **ordinarily
hash-value comparison**: data copied from electronic devices, storage
media, and files are "ordinarily authenticated by 'hash value'...
identical hash values for the original and copy reliably attest...
that they are exact duplicates." The proponent must also give the
adverse party **reasonable written notice** plus access to the record
and certification (the Rule 902(11) notice requirement).

> **Correction (2026-06, validated against Cornell LII rule text, the
> 2017 Advisory Committee Note, and G. Joseph, *Self-Authentication
> of Electronic Evidence*):** earlier versions of this document
> asserted a "two-prong" requirement whose prong (b) was *a trusted
> timestamp from an independent third party*. **That prong does not
> exist.** Neither 902(13) nor 902(14) requires a third-party
> timestamp. The rule requires only the qualified-person
> certification via a process of digital identification (ordinarily
> hashing) plus 902(11) notice. VERDICT supplies the hash-value
> identification component; it does not replace the qualified person's
> certification or notice. The sigstore/Rekor signature is
> **defense-in-depth, not a legal prerequisite.**

**How VERDICT supports the actual requirement:**

- **Accurate process of digital identification (the rule's core):**
  every evidence image is SHA-256 hashed at `case_open` and every
  tool output is content-addressed by SHA-256. The `verify_finding`
  MCP tool re-executes any cited `tool_call_id` and confirms the
  original output's hash matches. The readiness packet gives a qualified
  person the process record needed to make a certification; the software and
  its automatic expert-signoff template do not themselves become that person
  or guarantee legal compliance. This is the hash-value identification the
  Advisory Committee Note contemplates.
- **Signature + transparency log (supplementary, not required):**
  Sigstore's Rekor transparency log records the signature with an
  authenticated append-only inclusion proof. This strengthens identity-bound
  provenance, but Rekor's ordinary `integratedTime` is not part of the Merkle
  leaf and is not, by itself, a cryptographically trusted timestamp. The
  902(14) admissibility claim does not depend on either property.
  - **Historical (pre-A5):** an OpenTimestamps/Bitcoin tier was **removed under
    Amendment A5 and is not part of the current chain.** The current Rekor path
    provides authenticated inclusion/provenance, not the removed tier's
    no-single-party timestamp. This is supplementary to — not part of — the
    902(14) requirement.
  - **Merkle-root anchoring opt-in (verified 2026-07-05):** publishing the
    audit Merkle root to Rekor (with an RFC-3161 TSA fallback) is a double-locked
    opt-in — the `manifest_finalize` call must pass `anchor_transparency=True`
    **and** the operator must set `FINDEVIL_REKOR_ENABLE=1`; requesting it
    without the env fails closed. New manifests commit the boolean
    `transparency_anchor_requested` inside the signed body before the proof block
    is attached. Therefore, stripping the after-signing `transparency_log`, or
    leaving a requested proof missing, `kind="none"`, unauthenticated, or
    invalid, makes both `transparency_ok` and `overall` fail. Legacy manifests
    without the field, and manually attached proofs on explicitly unrequested
    runs, retain their non-gating compatibility behavior. Rekor bundles
    authenticate only under Sigstore's production roots plus exact identity and
    issuer policy. The RFC-3161 fallback currently parses the token and matches
    its message imprint, but does **not** pin or verify the TSA certificate chain;
    it is therefore an unauthenticated structural side-signal and cannot satisfy
    a requested authenticated anchor. The opt-in stays off by default with no
    network touch; only the bare 32-byte root egresses when enabled.

A court looking at a `run.manifest.json` three years from now
can establish the record's integrity from the hash chain and signature
offline when it also has the signer trust policy obtained outside the case,
without trusting VERDICT or the analyst. Rekor inclusion is supplementary
identity/transparency evidence, not a trusted-time prerequisite for the core
902(14) digital-identification showing. Certification, notice, and admissibility
remain matters for the qualified person, parties, and court.

## The negative test (live demonstration)

The DC investigation report (§7) demonstrates tamper detection
end-to-end. Flip any byte of any field; verification fails with a
diagnostic that names exactly what diverged:

```bash
# Tamper with the Merkle root field of an existing manifest:
python -c "
import json, pathlib
p = pathlib.Path('run.manifest.json')
d = json.loads(p.read_text())
d['merkle_root_hex'] = 'ff' * 32   # 64 hex chars = 32 bytes
p.write_text(json.dumps(d, indent=2, sort_keys=True))
"

# Verify — expect failure with diagnostic:
# manifest_verify {
#   manifest_path: "run.manifest.json",
#   expected_ed25519_fingerprint: "<trusted SHA-256 obtained outside the case>"
# }
# →
# {
#   "overall": false,
#   "audit_chain_ok": true,
#   "merkle_root_ok": false,
#   "merkle_root_detail": "declared root ff..ff != rebuilt fbc25852755b...",
#   "signature_present": true
# }
```

The audit chain still verifies (we didn't tamper with the chain),
but the Merkle root fails — the rebuilt root from `leaves[]` is
the original `fbc25852755b...`, not the `ff..ff` we wrote in.
Same shape if you tamper with any audit record (chain breaks at
the seq you altered) or any signed body field (signature
verification fails).

This is exercised on every `agent-mcp-smoke.py` run as a deliberate
negative test — see `scripts/agent-mcp-smoke.py` "10. tampered
manifest is rejected" step.

---

## What this attestation does NOT prove

Honest disclosure (per `docs/false-positives.md` and SOUL.md):

- **Not the truth of the findings.** The chain proves the agent ran
  the named tool calls and recorded the named outputs — it does
  not prove those outputs *correctly identify* malicious activity.
  An agent emitting wrong analysis with cryptographic precision
  is still emitting wrong analysis. The `verify_finding` veto +
  the SOUL.md ≥2-artifact correlator + the Pool A vs B
  contradiction surface are the *epistemic* guardrails; the chain
  is the *integrity* guardrail. Both are needed.
- **Not the trustworthiness of the SIFT VM or Volatility's symbol
  cache.** If the SIFT VM's vol3 is compromised before the
  agent runs, the SHA-256 of the tool output is the SHA-256 of
  the *compromised* output. Defense-in-depth (read-only mounts,
  unprivileged user, no `execute_shell`) is the architectural
  layer; the cryptographic layer assumes those guardrails hold.
- **Not the absence of evidence.** A valid manifest covers the
  evidence the agent looked at. Evidence not collected (e.g. a
  full disk image from a host where only memory was acquired)
  is not part of the chain. The DC investigation report §8
  enumerates this caveat explicitly.
