# VERDICT DFIR — Quickstart

For the project pitch + claims, see [README.md](README.md). For the full doc map, see [`docs/README.md`](docs/README.md).

---

## Quickstart in 3 steps

```bash
git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/TimothyVang/verdict-dfir-beta.git verdict && cd verdict
bash scripts/setup                    # installs the product toolchain, common DFIR tools, browser helpers, and both MCP servers, then runs doctor
scripts/verdict <path-to-evidence>    # investigate -> live dashboard -> signed verdict + report
```

**Prefer to drive it with Claude Code?** Drop your evidence into **`evidence/`**, launch
`scripts/find-evil --acknowledge-evidence-egress`, and type **`investigate evidence/`**. The
acknowledgment is required because parsed evidence-derived output can enter the cloud model context;
raw source files are not uploaded by the typed tools. For zero-LLM local processing, use
`scripts/verdict <path>` directly in your terminal.

No evidence yet? `bash scripts/fetch-fixtures.sh` stages public datasets (into `fixtures/`). A view-only Google Drive artifact folder is also available at <https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1j4nPm3vjAcRwVdKOauIVc8yurxoADhOv?usp=drive_link>; CLI users can download it with their own authenticated rclone Google Drive remote:

```bash
rclone config create gdrive drive scope drive
rclone copy --drive-root-folder-id 1j4nPm3vjAcRwVdKOauIVc8yurxoADhOv gdrive: ./verdict-dfir-artifacts --progress
scripts/verdict ./verdict-dfir-artifacts/network-captures/nitroba/nitroba.pcap
```

Canonical install detail — prerequisites and how to verify — is in [INSTALL.md](INSTALL.md).

**Everything below is "going deeper"** — environment choices (SIFT VM vs. local) and the full
run-mode catalog.

---

## 1. Pick your environment (one-time, ~15 min)

### Path A — DFIR container (recommended; the reference forensic backend)

Pull the pinned toolchain image (~2.3 GB) and run against it. The image declares its toolchain in
`docker/dfir.Dockerfile` and its `HEALTHCHECK` fails when `tshark`/`fls`/`ewfexport`/`vol`/`hayabusa`
are not invocable, so a lane cannot silently read zero packets the way a drifted VM could.

```bash
FINDEVIL_DFIR_GHCR='ghcr.io/<owner>/verdict-dfir-toolkit@sha256:<reviewed-digest>' \
  scripts/verdict <evidence>
```

The Docker evidence runtime is always networkless and capability-free. Raw
`.dd`/`.001` uses direct Sleuth Kit. Compressed `.E01` mounting is intentionally
refused in Docker because it requires a root/FUSE boundary; use local/SIFT or
`ewfexport` the image to a raw `.dd` first.

Evidence is a bind mount (native disk speed, no hgfs), and the container is driven over `docker exec -i`
— the same stdio pipe `ssh -T` gives the VM. Two honest limits, both detailed in
[docs/using/docker-backend.md](docs/using/docker-backend.md):

- **`mac_triage` / mac_apt are not in the image** and degrade to `BinaryNotFound`. Use Path B for those.
- **Compressed `.E01` mounting is not enabled in Docker.** `ewfexport` the set
  to a raw `.dd`, or use local/SIFT.

Docker is the no-flag production default. `--local` and `--sift` are mutually
exclusive alternatives and require `--acknowledge-reduced-isolation` because
native parsers then share an OS trust domain with custody/signing.

### Path B — SIFT VM (supported; required for the mac_triage lanes)

**The one-command way** — install local prerequisites, attempt the gated OVA fetch via Playwright,
and build the VM when the download succeeds:

```bash
bash scripts/setup --with-sift
```

If the headless fetch can't complete (the SANS page changed, you're offline, a hypervisor is
missing), it falls back cleanly and tells you the manual step below — and local-host mode (Path C)
still works meanwhile. In a `claude` session, typing `setup` does the same and can adapt to page
changes.

**Manual OVA download (fallback, one-time, ~9.3 GB).** The SANS SIFT Workstation OVA is **not** shipped in this repo (it is SANS-licensed, gitignored as `*.ova`, and far larger than GitHub's file limit). Download it yourself:

1. Go to **<https://www.sans.org/tools/sift-workstation/>**
2. Scroll to the **VM** option and download the OVA (~9.3 GB).
3. Save it to the repo root as `sift-2026.03.24.ova` (or point `OVA_PATH` at wherever you saved it).

```bash
# From the repo root, on Windows with VMware Workstation installed
# and the OVA saved as sift-2026.03.24.ova in the repo root:
bash scripts/sift-vm-bootstrap.sh
```

This converts the OVA, boots the VM headless, installs Rust + DFIR tools inside, sets up the SSH transport, and rewrites `.mcp.json.sift` to point at the running VM. Runs ~15 min on first invocation; subsequent runs detect existing state and skip.

> **Hypervisor note:** `scripts/verdict <path> --sift --acknowledge-reduced-isolation` invokes the SIFT helper under the hood. It supports **VMware Workstation** (primary, via `vmrun`/`ovftool`) or **KVM/libvirt** (Linux fallback — `scripts/sift-vm-bootstrap.sh` auto-installs qemu/libvirt and imports the OVA). **VirtualBox is not supported.** If you only have VirtualBox, use VMware or KVM/libvirt, or keep the Docker default.

### Path C — Windows via WSL2 or Docker (faster iteration)

```bash
# From a WSL2 shell, install/verify the contained Linux toolchain:
bash scripts/setup
bash scripts/doctor.sh

# The normal command uses isolated Docker. Host-local parsing is an explicit,
# reduced-isolation development fallback:
scripts/verdict <path-visible-in-WSL>
scripts/verdict --local --acknowledge-reduced-isolation <path-visible-in-WSL>
```

Native Windows parser binaries remain useful for development and the PowerShell
smoke/readiness wrappers remain supported, but a native-NTFS custody run is
deliberately refused: POSIX `0600`/`0700` modes do not establish private Windows
DACLs, and the current audit lock is POSIX. Use WSL2, Docker, or SIFT for a
signed Case. This prevents a report from claiming protected custody when local
keys/audit files could inherit access from another Windows principal.

---

## 2. Choose a run mode

### Option 2C — the `/verdict` skill (turnkey, recommended)

After explicitly consenting with
`scripts/find-evil --acknowledge-evidence-egress`, type:

```
/verdict <path-to-evidence>
```

The skill is the turnkey path: it checks/builds the MCP servers, attempts SIFT VM setup when disk
evidence needs it, auto-uses `--sift` when the VM is reachable, runs the parallel investigation to
a signed Verdict, opens the dashboard + report, and prints the Verdict plus workflow status.
Optional n8n/grounding actions stay off even
when a service is reachable; add `--acknowledge-post-verdict-egress` to authorize that separate,
post-verdict network step. Full reference:
[docs/using/running-verdict.md §0](docs/using/running-verdict.md). (Loaded at session start — if you
just pulled it, start a fresh `claude` session.)

### Option 2A — Interactive Claude Code session (best for exploration)

```bash
# Local mode:
scripts/find-evil --acknowledge-evidence-egress

# Equivalent explicit environment gate for a bare Claude launch:
FINDEVIL_ACKNOWLEDGE_PARSED_EVIDENCE_EGRESS=1 claude

# SIFT-VM evidence run:
scripts/verdict <path-to-evidence> --sift
```

`.mcp.json` (or `.mcp.json.sift`, swapped automatically) tells Claude Code to spawn both audit-chained product MCP servers — `findevil-mcp` (Rust, 43 typed DFIR tools) and `findevil-agent-mcp` (Python, 14 typed crypto/ACH/memory/ACP/expert-feedback tools), for 57 product tools total.

This consent covers parsed rows, filenames, hashes, and custody metadata entering the selected model
context. It does not authorize uploading raw evidence files. Without the gate, evidence-facing Rust
tool calls are denied before producing parsed output.

In the session, prompt:

> investigate `<path-to-evidence>`

The agent reads `agent-config/SOUL.md` → `AGENTS.md` → `PLAYBOOK.md` → `TOOLS.md` → `MEMORY.md` → `HEARTBEAT.md` at session start, then drives the playbook tool sequence for that evidence type.

### Option 2B — `verdict` (the one command, no human input)

```bash
scripts/verdict <evidence> [--local|--sift] [--acknowledge-reduced-isolation] [--no-dashboard] [--unattended]
```

`verdict` runs the whole workflow in split-trust Docker by default: preflight → investigate → open
the live dashboard at the case → signed verdict + report. SIFT and host-local alternatives require
the explicit reduced-isolation acknowledgment.

Examples:

All direct `/mnt/...` SIFT evidence paths must be mounted read-only in the guest.

```bash
# Memory image:
scripts/verdict --sift --acknowledge-reduced-isolation /mnt/hgfs/evidence/extracted/base-dc/base-dc-memory.img --unattended

# Single EVTX from a read-only SIFT-visible evidence mount:
scripts/verdict --sift --acknowledge-reduced-isolation /mnt/hgfs/evidence/single-evtx/Security.evtx --unattended

# Disk image (read-only mount/extract where prerequisites support it; otherwise custody-only):
scripts/verdict --sift --acknowledge-reduced-isolation /mnt/hgfs/evidence/disk-images/base-dc-cdrive.E01 --unattended

# Host evidence root mounted read-only inside SIFT; skips multi-GB SCP staging:
FINDEVIL_SIFT_HOST_EVIDENCE_ROOT=/path/to/evidence \
FINDEVIL_SIFT_GUEST_EVIDENCE_ROOT=/mnt/verdict-evidence \
scripts/verdict /path/to/evidence/disk-images/base-dc-cdrive.E01 --sift --acknowledge-reduced-isolation --unattended

# Mixed case directory (memory, EVTX, disk artifacts, network logs, Velociraptor zips):
scripts/verdict --sift --acknowledge-reduced-isolation /mnt/hgfs/evidence/cases/base-dc/ --unattended

# Same run, plus a machine-readable automation summary outside evidence paths:
scripts/verdict --sift --acknowledge-reduced-isolation /mnt/hgfs/evidence/cases/base-dc/ --unattended --run-summary tmp/run-summary.json

# Velociraptor collection zip:
scripts/verdict --sift --acknowledge-reduced-isolation /mnt/hgfs/evidence/velociraptor/base-dc.zip --unattended
```

What it does in one command (no interactive prompts):

1. Detects evidence type from the file extension or inventories a mixed case directory
2. Opens both MCP servers inside the SIFT VM via SSH stdio
3. case_open or case inventory -> tool sequence per type -> audit chain -> judge -> correlator -> manifest_finalize. Raw disk image support is bounded: auto mode attempts read-only mount/extract through local Sleuth Kit/libewf or SIFT, otherwise it records custody-only limitations and next actions.
4. Synthesizes Pool A (persistence-biased) and Pool B (exfil-biased) findings deterministically from tool outputs
5. Writes `verdict.json` with the verdict (`SUSPICIOUS` / `NO_EVIL` / `INDETERMINATE` — see [`docs/verdict-semantics.md`](docs/verdict-semantics.md)), case completeness, ATT&CK/practitioner coverage, normalized timeline data, evidence-card data, source bibliography, and next analyst actions
6. Generates a fully-templated PDF investigation report (figures + findings + ATT&CK/practitioner coverage + timeline + visual evidence cards + source bibliography + chain-of-custody attestation)
7. If `--run-summary <path>` is set, writes a JSON pointer/QA file containing `run_id`, `case_id`, evidence path, local run directory, output artifact paths, report QA, release-gate/expert-signoff state, signer, readiness state, blockers, warnings, and final result. Keep this path outside evidence directories; `tmp/run-summary.json` is the recommended local default.

Output (on host):
```
tmp/auto-runs/auto-<uuid>/
├── audit.jsonl
├── run.manifest.json
├── manifest_verify.json
├── verdict.json
├── expert_signoff.json
├── customer_release_gate.final.json
├── timeline.json
├── timeline.csv
├── REPORT.md / .html / .pdf
└── figures/
```

`run-summary.json` is written wherever you pass `--run-summary`; it is not copied into the case directory unless you choose a path there. `scripts/verdict` delegates to the internal engine for this run; call the engine directly only when debugging engine-only flags.

Run with `--no-report` to skip PDF rendering (saves ~5 seconds).

### Option 2D — Fleet investigation (entire host inventory)

When the case is "we have N memory images, find all the evil," chain three scripts:

```bash
python scripts/fleet_investigate.py [--limit N] [--skip BASENAMES]
python scripts/fleet_correlate.py [tmp/fleet-runs/<fleet-id>]
python scripts/render_fleet_report.py [tmp/fleet-runs/<fleet-id>]
```

Output: `tmp/fleet-runs/fleet-<timestamp>/FLEET_REPORT.{md,html,pdf}` plus per-host artifacts and four matplotlib figures. Cross-host process correlation filters known-benign enterprise binaries via `COMMON_WIN_PROCS` in `scripts/fleet_correlate.py` — see [`docs/false-positives.md`](docs/false-positives.md) "Fleet cross-host correlation" for what is and isn't filtered.

---

## 3. (If interactive) the agent drives the playbook

You'll see:

1. `case_open` — SHA-256 of the evidence (chain of custody starts here)
2. **Pool A** (persistence) and **Pool B** (exfil) subagents fork in parallel and run their tool sequences
3. Findings emerge tagged with `tool_call_id`, MITRE ATT&CK technique, and confidence (CONFIRMED / INFERRED / HYPOTHESIS)
4. `detect_contradictions` surfaces Pool A vs Pool B disagreements **before** the judge merges
5. `judge_findings` + `correlate_findings` apply credibility weighting + the SOUL.md ≥2 artifact-class rule
6. `manifest_finalize` builds the Merkle tree, records signature metadata, and writes `run.manifest.json` — terminal step under Amendment A5. Local/offline automation can use a clearly identified stub signer; customer-release candidates require non-stub signing plus separate transparency-log validation.

Output lands at `~/.findevil/cases/<case_id>/` (or inside the VM at `/home/sansforensics/find-evil/tmp/<case_id>/` in SIFT-VM mode).

Verifying a manifest someone else produced: obtain the Ed25519 public-key SHA-256 through a trusted channel outside the case, then pass it to `manifest_verify` as `expected_ed25519_fingerprint` (or to `findevil_agent.crypto.manifest.verify_manifest` directly). Never trust the manifest's own fingerprint as the pin. Recipe + expected output: [`docs/cryptographic-attestation.md`](docs/cryptographic-attestation.md) §"How a third party verifies offline."

## Where to read next

For the full doc map (every file with status badge + one-line purpose), see [`docs/README.md`](docs/README.md). High-traffic entries when something goes wrong:

- "Every `verdict` flag, run mode, and output file" → [`docs/using/running-verdict.md`](docs/using/running-verdict.md) (canonical). Entry points: `scripts/verdict` is canonical; `find-evil-run`/`find-evil-live` are deprecated shims; `find-evil-auto` is the internal engine; `find-evil-sift` is the SIFT helper.
- "What must I install, and what version?" → [`docs/reference/dependencies.md`](docs/reference/dependencies.md) + run `bash scripts/doctor.sh`.
- "Something failed — what does this error mean?" → [`docs/troubleshooting.md`](docs/troubleshooting.md) (every failure mode → its code-enforced detector → the fix command).
- "How do I avoid false positives?" → [`docs/false-positives.md`](docs/false-positives.md)
- "What does the agent actually do?" → [`agent-config/PLAYBOOK.md`](agent-config/PLAYBOOK.md)
- "What evidence is available?" → [`docs/DATASET.md`](docs/DATASET.md)
- "What if a tool is missing?" → The agent returns `BinaryNotFound -32602`. Install the binary OR set the env var pointing at it (e.g. `VOLATILITY_BIN=/path/to/vol`).
- "I changed something — how do I prove the app still works?" → run a **live test**: `scripts/verdict evidence/<file>` (e.g. an evidence file you supply under `evidence/`, or a fixture staged by `scripts/fetch-fixtures.sh`), then confirm `tmp/auto-runs/<case-id>/verdict.json` has a real Verdict with `tool_call_id`-cited Findings and `manifest_verify.json` has both `overall=true` and `signature_verified=true` for the default Ed25519 tier. A live test — not a smoke run — is the verification standard.
- "I changed something — how do I confirm L1 CI will be happy?" → `bash scripts/run-all-smokes.sh` on POSIX/Git Bash, or `powershell -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File scripts/run-all-smokes.ps1` on native Windows. These are CI-predictor smoke runners, not live tests: they predict what L1 runs but don't exercise a real investigation. The scripts print the current smoke tally; runtime depends on Rust cache and shell startup. If native Windows Git Bash startup is slow enough to trip launcher syntax-check timeouts, set `FINDEVIL_LAUNCHER_SMOKE_BASH_TIMEOUT_SECONDS` to a larger value before rerunning.
- "How do I produce a review packet?" → `powershell -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File scripts/readiness-gate.ps1 -Mode Full -EvidencePath <path-inside-sift-vm> -RunL1Docker`. The gate writes `readiness-summary.json` and `readiness-packet.zip` under `tmp/readiness-gates/<run-id>/`, with packet/readiness-packet-manifest.json listing copied artifacts. Fixed `-RunId` reruns refresh generated packet contents and may create a fresh timestamped build child run. A passing gate prints `READY_FOR_EXPERT_REVIEW`, not customer-ready; a failing gate prints `READINESS_BLOCKED` and lists blockers in `readiness-summary.json`.

---

## Anti-patterns

* **Don't** trust HYPOTHESIS-tier findings without verification. The agent prefixes them with the literal word "hypothesis:" — those are leads, not facts.
* **Don't** skip the synthetic-benign baseline (`goldens/synthetic-benign/`) — running on benign data first calibrates your false-positive floor.
* **Don't** modify evidence files. The chain-of-custody invariant is filesystem-enforced; any write to `/evidence/<case_id>/` from outside the agent invalidates the manifest's claims.
* **Don't** add `execute_shell` or any tool that takes arbitrary commands. The "narrow typed surface" is the architectural pitch; widening it forfeits that.

## End-of-investigation checklist

0. [ ] Live test passed: `scripts/verdict` produced `verdict.json` and `manifest_verify.json` with `overall=true` and an authenticated `signature_verified=true`
1. [ ] `manifest_verify.json` or a fresh `manifest_verify` MCP/library result returns `overall=True`; for Ed25519, the verifier received the trusted external fingerprint and returned `signature_verified=True`
2. [ ] Findings table reviewed; CONFIRMED-tier findings traced back to their `tool_call_id` in `audit.jsonl`
3. [ ] Contradictions resolved or explicitly flagged in the report
4. [ ] Cross-host corroboration done (if multi-host case)
5. [ ] Synthetic-benign baseline run produced zero findings
6. [ ] Report rendered to PDF or HTML in the case output directory
7. [ ] Readiness packet created and reviewed if this is a release/customer-review candidate

If all relevant checks are complete, you're done. If any are skipped, document the reason in the report's §8 (Limitations).
