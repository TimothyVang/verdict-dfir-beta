"""verifier-discipline-smoke - mechanical, LLM-free verifier-discipline gate.

A completed VERDICT run leaves a hash-chained ``audit.jsonl`` and scoped
``verdict.json``. Separately, ``manifest_verify`` re-checks the audit chain,
Merkle root, payload binding, and tier signature under trusted signer policy
(external Ed25519 pin or exact Sigstore identity + issuer). It does **not** rerun
tools. This smoke instead proves from the sealed records that the live verifier
was actually exercised for everything that shipped and that recovery records
cite real executed tool calls. A run could (in principle) ship a Finding whose ``tool_call_id`` never
appears as an executed ``tool_call_output``, ship a Finding the verifier
``rejected``, or log a ``course_correction`` blaming a tool call that never ran.

This smoke parses ``audit.jsonl`` + ``verdict.json`` and asserts, deterministically:

1. **Evidence anchor executed.** Every shipped ``Finding.tool_call_id`` resolves
   to a real ``tool_call_output`` record (the tool actually produced output — not
   a fabricated id).
2. **Verifier exercised, nothing rejected.** Every shipped CONFIRMED/INFERRED
   Finding has a matching ``verifier_action`` record, and no shipped Finding
   carries a ``verifier_action`` of ``rejected``.
3. **Counts reconcile (never pinned).** The shipped-finding count, the
   ``finding_approved`` record count, and the approved ``verifier_action`` count
   are cross-checked against each other — reconciled, not compared to a literal
   (CLAUDE.md: "do not hard-code counts ... reconcile, don't pin"). If a
   ``suppression_funnel`` tally is present it is reconciled too.
4. **Recovery cites executed tool calls.** Every ``course_correction`` /
   ``verdict_revision`` record that names a tool-call id (``trigger_tool_call_id``
   / ``tool_call_id`` / ``failed_tool_call_id``) points at a tool call that
   actually started or executed — not a fabricated command string.

The audit-record kinds mirror the typed ``AgentEvent`` union in
``services/agent/findevil_agent/events.py`` (``ToolCallOutput`` -> the persisted
``tool_call_output`` kind, ``VerifierAction`` -> ``verifier_action``, ``Finding``
-> ``finding_approved``); this smoke only *reads* those kinds.

Custody-neutral: read-only over committed artifacts; it never re-signs, mutates
the chain, or changes any scoring math.

Usage::

    python3 scripts/verifier-discipline-smoke.py            # self-test + committed fixtures
    python3 scripts/verifier-discipline-smoke.py <run_dir>  # check one run dir

Exit 0 if every checked run is clean (and the self-test catches the negatives);
non-zero on the first discipline violation.
