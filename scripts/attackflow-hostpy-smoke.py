"""Guard: the attack-flow report hook must work under the ENGINE's host python.

The deterministic engine (`scripts/find_evil_auto.py`) imports `render_report`
and runs under host `python3`, which may be 3.10 — older than `findevil_agent`
(3.11: StrEnum, datetime.UTC). So `render_report._emit_attack_flow` imports
``attackflow`` as a TOP-LEVEL package, not via ``findevil_agent``. A regression
there makes the visualization silently dead in the live pipeline (0 artifacts,
no report summary) while every 3.11-venv test stays green.

This smoke drives the REAL hook (`render_report._emit_attack_flow`) under whatever
`python3` runs it, so that failure fails the gate. Run under host python (NOT the
agent venv): `python3 scripts/attackflow-hostpy-smoke.py`.
