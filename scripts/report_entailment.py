"""Render a finding's server-read evidence value (the sealed entailment slice).

The verifier seals an entailment slice onto each finding's replay artifact
(`findevil_agent.verifier`): for every asserted value it confirmed, the value the
deterministic parser READ from the re-run evidence (server-read, not
model-transcribed). The analyst report should surface that value, not only the
model's free-text description, so a tolerant match (a substring, a
differently-formatted timestamp, hex vs decimal) cannot let the model's spelling
reach the reader as the fact.

This turns the sealed slice into Markdown lines. It is deliberately stdlib-only
and operates on the already-serialized slice (a plain dict), so it is testable
without the report renderer's matplotlib dependency and adds no import weight to
the render path.
